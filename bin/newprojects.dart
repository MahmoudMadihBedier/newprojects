// at this session what we will learn ???
/*
the basic sentient  and the basic data type
int ----> for numbers like 1 ,2,3,4,5,6,7,89,...
double ---->for float numbers like 0.1 ,0.5 ,0.6,...
String --> for chr any thang put on "....."
var ---> for varible that we don't know what will be store on feature
----control flow statement----
if ( "condition has been boolean" ){
statement
}
like
if (i>=1){
print ("condition doesn't existed");
}
else if(i<=1){
print ("noooo");
}
else {
print (condition has been existed )
}
---loops ---
for (final object in flybyObjects) {
  print(object);

Task: Basic Dart Programming Exercise
Objective:
The purpose of this task is to test your understanding of Dart data types, conditionals (if statements), and loops.

Task Description:
Declare Variables:

Create a variable to store your name (String).
Create a variable to store your age (int).
Create a variable to store your height in meters (double).
Create a boolean variable to indicate if you are a student.
Print Variables:

Print the values of the variables you just created.
Conditional Statements:

Write an if-else statement to check if you are an adult (age 18 or older).
If you are an adult, print "You are an adult."
Otherwise, print "You are not an adult."
Write another if-else statement to check if you are a student.
If you are a student, print "You are a student."
Otherwise, print "You are not a student."
Loops:

Write a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10.
Write a while loop that prints the numbers from 10 down to 1.
Array and Loop:

Create an array of your favorite fruits.
Use a for loop to print each fruit in the array.
Function:

Write a function called greet that takes a name as a parameter and prints "Hello, <name>!".
 */


void main(){
  print ("welcome");
  print ("hi this is my data brife ");

  //Declare Variables:

  String Name ='Mahmoud';
  int age =24;
  double height=1.85;
  bool student =false ;

  //Print Variables:

  print('my name is $Name and i have $age yaers old ' );
  print ("my height is $height , and i had graduated $student");

  //Conditional Statements:
  if(age >=18){
    print ("You are an adult.");
  }else  {
  print("You are not an adult");
  }

if(student==true){
  print('You are a student.');
}else if (student==false){
  print("You are not a student");
  //Loops:
  for(int i=0 ; i<=age ;i++){
    print("your years is $i");
  }
  while (age<100){
    age+=1;
    print(age);
  }
